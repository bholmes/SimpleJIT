# SimpleJIT - A Simple Just-In-Time Compiler with Virtual Machine

A C# implementation of a simple JIT compiler and virtual machine that can read instruction files and execute them using either:
1. **Virtual Machine Interpreter** - Safe, cross-platform execution

## Features

- **Parse simple instruction language** from text files with support for `#` and `//` comments
- **Execute using a stack-based virtual machine** interpreter (guaranteed cross-platform)
- **Cross-architecture JIT compilation** to native assembly for both x64 and ARM64 processors
- **Two-stage memory allocation** with security-compliant executable memory management
- **Automatic architecture detection** with processor-specific code generation
- **Cross-platform compatibility** with intelligent fallback execution strategies
- **Comprehensive error handling** for stack underflow, division by zero, and file parsing errors
- **Professional testing suite** with 49 unit and integration tests using xUnit framework
- **Support for arithmetic operations** (add, sub, mul, div) and debugging prints
- **Flexible comment syntax** supporting both hash (`#`) and double-slash (`//`) comments
- **Platform-aware JIT compilation** that gracefully handles security restrictions

## Supported Instructions

- `load <value>` - Load immediate value onto stack (supports negative numbers)
- `add` - Add top two stack values  
- `sub` - Subtract top stack value from second-to-top
- `mul` - Multiply top two stack values
- `div` - Divide second-to-top by top stack value (with division by zero detection)
- `print` - Print top stack value to console (debugging aid)
- `ret` - Return from program with top stack value as result

### Comment Support
- `# comment` - Hash-style comments (can be inline or full line)
- `// comment` - C-style comments (can be inline or full line)

## Usage

### Console Application
```bash
# From the solution root (builds all projects)
dotnet build SimpleJIT.sln
dotnet run --project SimpleJIT samples/<instruction_file>

# Or build and run specific project
cd SimpleJIT
dotnet run ../samples/<instruction_file>
```

### As a Library
```csharp
using SimpleJIT.Core;

// Parse instructions from file
var instructions = Parser.ParseFile("myprogram.txt");

// Execute with VM (always works cross-platform)
var vm = new VirtualMachine();
var result = vm.Execute(instructions);

// Attempt JIT compilation (works on all major platforms and architectures)
var compiledFunction = JitCompiler.CompileInstructions(instructions);
if (compiledFunction != null)
{
    var jitResult = compiledFunction();
    Console.WriteLine($"JIT result: {jitResult}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Architecture: {System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.ProcessArchitecture}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("JIT compilation failed - using VM result");
}
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (via solution)
dotnet test

# Run tests via solution with detailed output
dotnet test SimpleJIT.sln --verbosity normal

# Run tests via specific project
dotnet test SimpleJIT.Tests/SimpleJIT.Tests.csproj --verbosity normal

# Run specific test category
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Unit"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Integration"
```

## Example Results

The program will:
1. Parse the instruction file
2. Execute using the VM interpreter (always works cross-platform)
3. Perform JIT compilation with automatic architecture detection (x64 or ARM64)
4. Execute JIT-compiled native code for optimal performance
5. Compare results between VM and JIT execution to ensure correctness

## Example Instruction Files

### Simple Addition (`samples/simple.txt`)
```
// Simple addition: 7 + 3 = 10
load 7
load 3
add
ret
```

### Complex Arithmetic (`samples/complex.txt`)
```
# Complex arithmetic: ((15 - 3) * 2) / 4 = 6
load 15
load 3
sub
load 2
mul
load 4
div
print
ret
```

### Multiple Operations with Comments (`samples/multi.txt`)
```
// Multiple operations with prints
load 100
load 25
sub        # Result: 75
print
load 5
mul        # Result: 375
print
load 3
div        # Result: 125
print
ret
```
