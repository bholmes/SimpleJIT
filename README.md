- `sub` - Subtract top stack value from second-to-top
- `mul` - Multiply top two stack values
- `div` - Divide second-to-top by top stack value (with division by zero detection)
- `print` - Print top stack value to console (debugging aid)
- `ret` - Return from program with top stack value as result

### Comment Support
- `# comment` - Hash-style comments (can be inline or full line)
- `// comment` - C-style comments (can be inline or full line)

## Usage

### Console Application
```bash
# From the solution root (builds all projects)
dotnet build SimpleJIT.sln
dotnet run --project SimpleJIT samples/<instruction_file>

# Or build and run specific project
cd SimpleJIT
dotnet run ../samples/<instruction_file>
```

### As a Library
```csharp
using SimpleJIT.Core;

// Parse instructions from file
var instructions = Parser.ParseFile("myprogram.txt");

// Execute with VM (always works cross-platform)
var vm = new VirtualMachine();
var result = vm.Execute(instructions);

// Attempt JIT compilation (automatically selects architecture-specific compiler)
var compiledFunction = JitCompiler.CompileInstructions(instructions);
if (compiledFunction != null)
{
    var jitResult = compiledFunction();
    Console.WriteLine($"JIT result: {jitResult}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Architecture: {System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.ProcessArchitecture}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("JIT compilation failed - using VM result");
}
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (via solution)
dotnet test

# Run tests via solution with detailed output
dotnet test SimpleJIT.sln --verbosity normal

# Run tests via specific project
dotnet test SimpleJIT.Tests/SimpleJIT.Tests.csproj --verbosity normal

# Run specific test category
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Unit"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Integration"
```

## Example Results

The program will:
1. Parse the instruction file
2. Execute using the VM interpreter (always works cross-platform)
3. Perform JIT compilation with automatic architecture detection (x64 or ARM64)
4. Execute JIT-compiled native code for optimal performance
5. Compare results between VM and JIT execution to ensure correctness
